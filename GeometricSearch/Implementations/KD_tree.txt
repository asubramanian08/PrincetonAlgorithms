2D trees: This is the same as a regular binary tree. The only difference is the level of a node determines 
whether it is a horizontal or vertical line.
KD trees: Similar to the 2D tree, a KD tree just operates in k dimensions. The dimension this is being used 
is i mod k where i is the level of a node in the tree. -> look at my PA for my code
