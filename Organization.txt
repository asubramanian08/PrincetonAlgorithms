Every section gets its own folder regardless of week

The *_PA folder is where MY code for the unit is
The GeneralCode folder are where outline and generic code for that topic is (ex. client)
The implementations folder is where different implementations of the topic is written
The OtherCodes folder is where all specific examples of code is
The interview file is where the interview questions for that week are
