NOTE: This can get language specific
Strings in java are immutable -> methods pg 8-9
String Builder vs. String -> data types in question
    reverse string
    array of suffix(will revisit)
    Longest common prefix (util get to a point thats not equal)
Radix -> number of character values a string can hold
Key index counting (bucket sort) -> O(N)        KIC
    The key is a small integer -> use as array index.
    Other data stored with the keys -> then distribute keys
    Basis of other string sorting algorithms
LSD radix sort (Least significate digit first)
    -> sort the string buy KIC for each element in the string (last first)
MSD radix sort
    sort the sub array
    works for difference in sizes
    caching problems
3-way radix quick-sort
    Combines benefits of quicksort and MSD
    3 way partitioning just for quicksort -> very similar to 3 way quicksort
Operation table (of the above) pg 53
Suffix array: (down from here)
key word in context search -> Suffix sort (repeats come together), then binary search
longest repeated substring -> brings long repeated substrings together
Algorithm solution: Manber-Myers (to the suffix array) linearithmic *pg 69* -> uses index sort
