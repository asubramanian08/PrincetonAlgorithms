General: shortest path (directed graphs)
Directed Edge (from and to edge methods)
Edge weighted digraph -> uses the directed edge
    -> this is what all the shorted path algo.s use
Notice: -> the shortest path with be a tree
Move up to tree to determine the path
Edge relaxing -> find a better path
Optimality condition (is the SP correct) pg 21
Note these algo.s are a lot like the spanning tree algo.s
Algorithms:
    Dijkstra (nonnegative weights) -> priority queue of edges | lot like prim algo
    Topological sort (no directed cycles) -> relax all edges in topological order
        -> picture shrinking, longest path -> job order (some have to be done before others)
    Bellman-Ford (no negative cycles) 
        -> loop though all edges and relax them until no improvements
        -> negative cycles check -> currency gaining money -> take the negative log
