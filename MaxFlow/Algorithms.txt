Cut -> some of the capacity(weight) of the edge from set A to B
Min cut - find the min cut that will completely partition A from B (with min cost)
Flow -> less than the capacity and greater than 0, the in flow of a vertex = outflow of a vertex
Maximize the flow going out from the source or in to the target (same thing)
NOTE: the problems are pretty much the same
Ford-Fulkerson -> keep finding path and add the bottleneck remaining flow to the each edge
many flow-cut relationships pg 26-36 -> ** page 32-34 **
Min cut = from max flow but searching the parts that aren't full and backwards paths that aren't empty
run time pg 49 -> break down each path ordering method
Data structures: 
    Flow edge (capacity, flow, from, to)
    Flow network -> just like a graph (adj) | uses flow edge
    Actual Ford-Fulkerson algorithm pg 60 (implementation does BFS)
Many applications pg 64 -> later pages (till end) also contain it
