MST (covers all the nodes with minimal edge usage)
 - Kruskal (add smallest until it creates a cycle) + union find for cycles
 - Prim -> develope an lasting connected tree and add the shortest connection
to a non tree component (lazy and eager) + priority queue (changing key for eager)
 - BorÅ¯vka (not heavenly discussed in the lecture)
Many applications pg 11
Greedy algorithm -> the cut property of MST pg 16
Weighted edge class -> class that MST could use
Edge weighted graph (uses weighted edge)
Priority queue with key changing -> for prim eager algo.
MST search for best algo. list pg 63 (after that is other context)
