Regular Expression: a formula like thing that is a set of strings -> find in a text stream
Application list pg 6
Operator lists on pg 7-8
DFA: Deterministic Finite Automaton -> string is in set
Kleene theorem: a RE can be represented as a DFA and vice-versa
Use NFA: Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton
    Can make some moves with text
    Convert RE to NFA -> use the characters written and parenthesis
    -> construction (connecting chars in digraph) defined for each operation
       differently. pg 37-42 code on pg 45
    Store a set of all states you could be at
    DFS from set of vertices -> reachable
    Finding is text have to proper RE code pg. 32 - 33
