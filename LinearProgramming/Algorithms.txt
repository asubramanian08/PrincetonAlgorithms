Allocate scares resources to multiple activities
    Air planes use linear programming to schedule flights
Applications page -> pg 3
Brewer Problem -> Example problem, models real life situation
    given an amount of corn hops and malt
    given the recipe and prices to make beer and ale
    how much ale and beer should be made to maximize profits
Draw lines for the inequalities on a graph and find the feasible region -> always convex
Answer has to be an extreme points -> if one point it better than all its neighbors, it is the best
Simplex Algorithm -> keep going to adjacent points that are not worse until stuck ** HARD
    Basis: variables being solved for
    Do a pivot: solve for a variable and take some other vars out of the basis
    Use the minimum ratio rule to choose the row
    Stop pivoting once the optimal answer (negative coefficients) is reached
    Bland rule: find the first index that is positive, otherwise it equation is optimal
    Stalling: If multiple lines intersect at the same point it could be looking at the same point
    Cycling: If you removing variable causes infinite cycle (prevented with Bland rule)
There are many linear programming libraries ...
THIS IS A REALLY USEFUL AND GENERIC PROGRAM THAT CAN BE USED FOR A LOT OF THINGS
