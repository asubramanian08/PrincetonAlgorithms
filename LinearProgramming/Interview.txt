Q:  Feasibility detection. Suppose that you want to solve a linear program but you don't have a starting initial 
basic feasible solution—perhaps the all 0 vector is not feasible. Design a related linear program whose solution 
will be a basic feasible solution to the original linear program (assuming the original linear program has a 
basic feasible solution).
A:  Make a new linear program that predetermines a variable?
Hint:   add new artificial variables to each row and let the artificial variables be the initial basis. Select 
the objective function to drive the artificial variables out of the basis. This is known as Phase I of the 
simplex algorithm.

Q:  Detecting unboundedness. Describe how to modify the simplex algorithm to detect an unbounded linear program—a 
linear program in which there is a feasible solution that makes the objective function arbitrarily large.
A:  Just check that every variable used is on the left side of an equation and that the number of constraints is 
greater than or equal to the number of variables.
Hint:   identify a vector d≠0 such that if x is a feasible solution, then so is x+αd for any α>0. To identify such 
a vector d, consider what happens when the simplex algorithm has an entering column but no leaving row (because 
all entries in that column are nonpositive).

Q:  Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem. Consider the polyhedron P defined by ∑ixij=1, ∑jxij=1, and xij≥0. Prove that all 
extreme points of P have integer coordinates (0 or 1).
A:  ?
Hint:   let x∈P be a vector that has some fractional entries. Prove that x is not an extreme point by expressing 
it as the convex combination of two vectors x+ϵy and x−ϵy. To identify y, find a cycle in the bipartite graph that 
has a vertex for each i and j and an edge (i,j) if and only if 0<xij<1.
