## PrincetonAlgorithms

### About

I took the Princeton coursera courses ([part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)) to gain a better understanding of popular algorithms. In this repos I have my notes for each topic and my java code for the programming projects. NOTE: This is actually the coursera equivalent of Princeton [COS 226](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring21/cos226/).

### Organization

Each folder is dedicated to one week of either the [part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) or [part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) courses. It highlights one algorithms that is discussed that week. Each such folder contains:
* Algorithms.txt: List of algorithms / topics discussed (my version of notes)
* _optional_ Interview.txt: The questions and my responses to their given interview questions.
* _private_ The week's lecture: A large PDF covering all the slide discussed in the week
* _optional_ Programming assignment folder named "(Assignment)_PA":
    * Assignment.txt: Link to the assignment specifications
    * All related *.java code that is submitted
    * The .zip file: compressed version of the submitted code
