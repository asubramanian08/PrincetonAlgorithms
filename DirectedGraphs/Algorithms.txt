Digraph -> connections are directed only from one point to another
Many applications on pg. 11
DSF -> Is connected, topological sort -> More complex things like 2-satisfiability, 
directed Eular path, Strong Connectivity (connects both ways between 2 nodes)
BFS -> shortest path
 - Web crawler -> go thorough the link in a page
Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm -> connected components
