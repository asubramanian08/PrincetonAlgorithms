Trie: Searching with string keys (said instead of tree) -> R-way
    Each key is given a value / key
    Break the words down by sequence letter
    Search hit self explanatory
    Search miss can be a null link or doesn't match the end destination
    Create new links when adding something (again obvious)
    Also easy to delete -> just set value to null
Ternary Search Trie -> fix memory problem (TST)
    Every node has 3 children -> smaller, equal, larger
    Search algo is simple
    Just follow the tree for the insert.
    MUCH LESS NULL LINKS
Other operations -> can so spell correcting
    Match a prefix | auto complete
    wild card -> any letter Goes
    Longest prefix -> longest key that is prefix of given string | Id address
    Sorted iteration
    T9 texting -> guess word
Patricia Trie -> sequence of chars per node | good for binary tries
Suffix tree
