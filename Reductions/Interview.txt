Q:  Longest path and longest cycle. Consider the following two problems
    LongestPath: Given an undirected graph G and two distinct vertices s and t, find a simple path (no repeated 
vertices) between s and t with the most edges.
    LongestCycle: Given an undirected graph G′, find a simple cycle (no repeated vertices or edges except the 
first and last vertex) with the most edges.
Show that LongestPath linear-time reduces to LongestCycle.
A:  There is a way to solve the longest path problem using the longest cycle. Just take the graph G and connect 
s and t with a weight of infinity or some high number. Run the longest cycle problem and subtract that big number 
from the answer.
Hint:   add a new path (with new vertices) between s and t.

Q:  3Sum and 4Sum. Consider the following two problems:
    3Sum: Given an integer array a, are there three distinct indices i, j, and k such that ai+aj+ak=0?
    4Sum: Given an integer array b, are there four distinct integers i, j, k, and l such that bi+bj+bk+bl=0?
Show that 3Sum linear-time reduces to 4Sum.
A:  ?
Hint:   define M=1+maxi∣ai∣. To solve an instance of 3Sum with N integers, form an instance of 4Sum with N+1 
integers containing only one negative value (−3M).

Q:  3Sum and 3Linear. Consider the following two problems:
    3Linear: Given an integer array a, are there three indices (not necessarily distinct) i, j, and k such that 
ai+aj=8ak?
    3Sum: Given an integer array b, are there three indices (not necessarily distinct) i, j, and k such that 
bi+bj+bk=0?
Show that 3Linear linear-time reduces to 3Sum.
A:  For every number of array a add itself and -8ai into the array b. Then if the 3 sum is true, then the 3 liner 
is.
Hint:   define M=1+maxi∣ai∣. To solve an instance of 3Linear with n integers, form an instance of 3Sum with 2n 
integers.
