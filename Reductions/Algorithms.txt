Classify problem baced on the order of the algorithm
Reduction is a tool to break down a problem, Ex:
    to find median, sort then return middle
    find if elements are the same, sort then have a pass though array
    Example page -> pg 11
    Also detailed examples on pg 12 - 17
Reduction helps establish lower bounds -> the lower bound spreads
    * sorting can be done using a convex hull so convex hull lower bound is n*log(n) *
If x linear time reduces to Y and criss-cross then they have the same complexity
Hard to classify but can put in categories
