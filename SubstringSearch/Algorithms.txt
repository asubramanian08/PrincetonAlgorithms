Substring searching -> looks for a "patter" in a long input stream
Applications: search and replace, stock price from yahoo ...
Brute force -> search through the text (increment i ptr) and j when two vals are equal
    pg 13, M*N worst case, You have to back up from the steam
Brute force 2.0 (no back up)
Knuth-Morris-Pratt
    Move along -> if wrong char find out next right char (from the pattern possibly)
    There is no back up -> precompute what pos to go to -> liner
    uses DFA -> deterministic finite state -> where to go given a character pg 27-32 ** pg 35 impl
    Might be too much memory in things like unicode
Boyer-Moore -> goes backward pg 46 -> can do skips best: O(N/M), worst: O(NM) or liner if use KMP combination
Rabin-Karp -> mod the constructed number of a large prime 
    keep looping until get the right number
    Compute hash pg 51-52
    Simple change from one set of numbers the the next ("just do some math")
    Adaptable to different problems -> 2D search ...
